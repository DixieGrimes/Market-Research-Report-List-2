<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Moisture Probes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capacitance Type</li><li>Resistor Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The soil moisture probes market features two primary types: capacitance and resistor probes. Capacitance-type probes measure soil moisture by detecting changes in capacitance as the dielectric permittivity of the soil varies with moisture levels. They are typically more durable and offer quicker readings. Resistor-type probes, on the other hand, measure moisture by evaluating the resistance between two electrodes, which changes as water content varies. Both types are essential for agricultural, horticultural, and environmental monitoring applications.</p></p>
