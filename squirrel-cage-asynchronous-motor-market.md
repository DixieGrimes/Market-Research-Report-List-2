<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Squirrel Cage Asynchronous Motor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Start</li><li>Voltage Drop Start</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Squirrel Cage Asynchronous Motor market is segmented into two main types: Direct Start and Voltage Drop Start. Direct Start involves initiating the motor at full voltage, providing immediate full torque but causing a high inrush current. In contrast, Voltage Drop Start gradually reduces the voltage supplied to the motor during startup, helping to limit the inrush current and avoid mechanical stress. Both methods serve varying applications based on energy efficiency and operational requirements in industrial and commercial settings.</p></p>
